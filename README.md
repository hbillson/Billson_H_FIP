# InFocus: Raising Awareness About ADHD and Making Effective Toys and Tools 

### Final Integrated Project

My website is a four-page, mostly informative webpage about Attention Defecit Interactive Disorder. My company, InFocus, started out as a non-profit organization simply raising awareness about the Disorder in both children and adults, but grew to make creative and fun fidget toys, organizational tools and other merchandize that are designed specifically with ADHD folks in mind. The pages I've completed are the main ADHD Information Page (which would link to more specific informative pages and facts), the About Us page and the (non-functional) Contact Us page. 

## Tools Used

For the logo design, Adobe Illustrator CC was used. For the website mockups and photo editing, Photoshop CC was used. All photos featured on the site were taken by me using the Nikon DX DSLR Camera. 

The HTML and CSS were written in Sublime Text 3. The GitBash terminal for Windows was used to push the website to this Reposistory. 

## Requirements

You will only need a good browser to see the website. It was designed for Google Chrome with a 1920 x 1080 resolution, so using those would make it look best. 

## Installation

Clone the project, cd to your directory / download, and open the .html files in your browser.
